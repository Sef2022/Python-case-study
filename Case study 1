1.
A Robot moves in a Plane starting from the origin point (0,0). The robot can move 
toward UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The trace of Robot movement is as given following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
The numbers after directions are steps.  Write a program to compute the distance current position after sequence of movements.
Hint: Use math module.


import math

x, y = 0, 0

while True:
    step = input("Type in UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT #step number: ")

    if step == "":
        break

    else:
        step = step.split(" ")

        if step[0] == "UP":
            y = y + int(step[1])
        elif step[0] == "DOWN":
            y = y - int(step[1])
        elif step[0] == "LEFT":
            x = x - int(step[1])
        elif step[0] == "RIGHT":
            x = x + int(step[1])

c = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

print("Distance:", c)
